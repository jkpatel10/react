           <p>Every chocolate we make begins with a story- yours. Whether it's a quiet craving or a grand gesture, every piece is designed with care, intention, and a pinch of personality. From cocoa bean to ribbon-tied box, every detail is considered. From hand-painted bonbons to custom packaging, we think of everything- so you don't have to.</p>
